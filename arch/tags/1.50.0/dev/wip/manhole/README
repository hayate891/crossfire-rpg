manhole.arc

  manhole_closed_1

    A HOLE modeled after arch/trunk/connect/Hole/pit.arc pit_closed, except
    that it is a multi-tile archetype, and that the non-head pieces are
    deliberately set to the wrong face so that the animation works.

  manhole_open_1

    A HOLE modeled after arch/trunk/connect/Hole/pit.arc pit_open that shows
    the animation is broken when the archetype is probably set up "correctly".

world_105_115.patch

    Test of pit_open, pit_closed, manhole_closed_1, and manhole_open_1. To
    apply the patch, and presuming that the maps and arch SVN checkouts are
    in the same directory, use the following command.

    $ patch -p0 world_105_115.patch

manhole.base.xcf

    This is a GIMP 64 x 64 bit image with layers and transparency.

    The elements used to construct the manhole .png files.  This file does also
    contain some variations of the archetype that could be used to produce
    different manholes (rust- colored vs. bronze, for example).

manhole.base.111.png
manhole.base.112.png
manhole.base.113.png
manhole.base.114.png

    A bronze manhole animation set.  111 is an open manhole. 112 and 113 are
    transitional shots of a manhole opening or closing, and 114 is the closed
    manhole.
