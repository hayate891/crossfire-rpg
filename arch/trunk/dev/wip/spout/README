SPOUT OVERLAYS by Kevin Bulgrien
===============================================================================

This is a first run at creating a set of overlays that may be reused in a
number of combinations:

pour_spout.arc
pour_spout.base.111.png : A wall spout with nothing coming out of it.  To be
                          placed on top of wall facings A or B, or possibly
                          even 2 and 8.  Not designed for use with "short"
                          walls like bwall, cave, dun, etc, but, a spout
                          could be created for them too.

pour_h2o.arc
pour_h2o.base.111.png
pour_h2o.base.112.png
pour_h2o.base.113.png
pour_h2o.base.114.png   : Animated pouring water to be placed over top of
                          the pour spout.  This arch and associated graphics
                          are not quite perfected.  The water is a bit to
                          dark for sea tiles, though might work for the
                          darker river water.

===============================================================================
GRAPHICS
===============================================================================

The spout.xcf contains many individual layers of components used to create the
above artwork.  Note that the water design was quite easy.  A single color
water was drawn, then GIMP's Filters | Noise | HSV Noise... was used to vary
the color.  The effect of the filter is somewhat random, so it was a simple
matter to generate variants of the water to make the water look like it was
flowing.

HSV Noise settings that seemed reasonable were as follows:

  Holdness:    2
  Hue:         3
  Saturation: 63
  Value:      63

The water is too dark to match the sea tiles, but might match the river water
colors.

The flowing  water needs to be wider to show up the animation on 32x32 tiles.
It is even a bit hard to see at 64x64 in jxclient.

The graphics are still in RGB format instead of INDEXED form, so they are not
compressed as well as they could be.  The conversion to INDEXED should be done
before releasing the graphics.

===============================================================================
POSSIBILITIES
===============================================================================

The possibilities of modular overlays becomes more evident if one concsiders
things like the following.

  Use the same pour_spout.arc on any "tall" wall for a number of variations
  on the wall/spout theme.

  Now, increase the variability by writing new replacement for pour_h2o.arc
  along the lines of pour_blood.arc, pour_sewage.arc, pour_fire.arc, etc.

===============================================================================
PROBLEMS
===============================================================================

Presently pour_spout.arc and/or pour_h2o.arc cause a wall piece placed below
them to disappear.  Only the floor graphic is visible.  This is probably a
map layer issue, so some experimentation will have to be done to figure out
how to get the wall piece to stay visible below the spout and animated water.
