Readme for Win32 (04 April 2009)
---------------------------------

Currently the only client supported is GTK v2.

This version of the client supports SDL and OpenGL rendering, but it
makes no attempt to detect which one is best for your system.  It's
strongly recommended that, before playing for the first time, you open
the configuration dialog (main menu, "Client", "Configure") and change
a few settings to your liking.  In particular, "Enable smoothing", and
on "Display mode", select OpenGL.  Save and restart (the client, not
your system).  If your map display doesn't work or has artifacts,
configure again and select SDL.

If using SDL and if your computer is relatively recent, you should
also set the "Lighting options" to "Best Per Pixel".

Finally, if you installed the extra layouts, you may want to try a few
of them.  Changing layouts requires a client restart.
