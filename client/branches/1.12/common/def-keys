# <keynro> will typically be the keycode for that key.  While
# keysyms are defined to work across different servers, keycodes are
# server/machine specific. Keycodes are only needed because some keyboards
# (sun's type 5 for one) have keys with no corresponding keysym.
# When loading, all keysyms are converted to keycodes for matching.
