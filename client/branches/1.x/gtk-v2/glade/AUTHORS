The original gtk-v2.glade file by Mark Wedel was the basis for the following
layout files.  In fact, all layouts for the GTK-v2 client must contain the
basic widget set found in that work.

- gtk-v2.glade
- dialogs.glade

The conversion of the client to support libglade came shortly after Kevin
Bulgrien began developing experimental alternative layouts by copying and
modifying the original gtk-v2.glade layout.  Some of those initial layouts
are are found in the following files:

- chthonic.glade
- gtk-v1.glade
- meflin.glade

    A player-suggested modification of an experimental layout developed prior
    to commencement of the libglade client conversion work.
