Notes about designing .glade files for the libglade version of the GTK2 client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) All windows that should not be initially displayed when the application
   starts must have the "visible" property set to "no".  This property is on
   the "Common" tab.

   The following windows should not be initially visible:

     metaserver_window
     keybinding_window
     config_window
     spell_window
     about_window

   Reference:

     http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/libglade/libglade-embedding.html

2) All hpane and vpane resizeable widgets that need to be saved when the user
   selects Client | Save Window Position should have a name that begins with
   either "hpaned_" or "vpaned_".  The client will only save window positions
   for the widgets named in this way (this is the default naming convention
   used by the Glade Designer application).
