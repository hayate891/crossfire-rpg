Readme for building Crossfire's GTK client under Windows (October 26th, 2003)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains instructions for compiling Crossfire's GTK client under Win32.
More information about Crossfire can be found at http://crossfire.real-time.com

Instructions for running the client can be found in Running.txt, in the same directory as this file.



The compilation have been tested with:
* Microsoft Visual Studio 6, SP 5 ('MSVC in this document')
* GTK 2.2.4.1


Requirements:
* you must have GTK installed, with development libraries.

Installation instructions for GTK:
* goto http://www.dropline.net/gtk/
* in 'download' sections, get 'GTK Runtime Environment' and 'GTK Development Environment'
    current version is 2.2.4.1, released October 12th, 2003
* install both somewhere (I suggest installing development libraries in the same base directory as runtime)

Notes:
* some products like GAIM (gaim.sf.net) also install GTK for you, but only the runtime environment.
* if you already have GTK installed, you can omit reinstalling the runtime environment.

**** WARNING ****
Use the same runtime environment and development environment, else you may have compatibilities issues.


Build instructions
------------------
* launch MSVC
* open 'GTKClient' workspace (located in the same directory as this file)
* open project settings (alt-F7)
* in 'Debug' tab, adjust 'executable for debug session' and 'working directory' for your system
* in 'C++' tab, category 'preprocessor', change 'Additional include directories' to match your GTK development install path.
   on my system, this gives:
    .,c:\program files\fichiers communs\gtk\2.0\include,..\..\common,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\include\gtk-2.0,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\include\glib-2.0,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\lib\glib-2.0\include,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\include\pango-1.0,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\lib\gtk-2.0\include,C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\include\atk-1.0,..\..
   (note: . is requires as include directory)
* in 'Link' tab, category 'input', change 'Additional library directories' to match GTK development path.
   on my system this gives:
    C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs\GTK\2.0\lib
* click 'ok'
* select either 'Win32 Debug' or 'Win32 Release' as target
* hit F7 to compile

If everything works fine, you'll have a working GTKClient executable.


Running the client
------------------
See the Running.txt for additional information.


Troubleshooting
---------------
If something goes wrong, first check all include and libraries paths are correct. Check GTK version for runtime and development.

If everything is fine, report your troubles to:
* Crossfire's messageboard: http://www.metalforge.net/cfmb/index.php
* Crossfire's mailing list: see http://crossfire.real-time.com for instructions on how to join it
