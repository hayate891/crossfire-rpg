How to make the client installer, March 04th, 2004
--------------------------------------------------

The installer script, gtkclient.nsi, is a NSIS script.
NSIS is available from http://nsis.sourceforge.net
You must install NSIS first, then launch the script.


Requirements
------------
You must make the gtkclient.nsi file in the gtk\win32 directory, else it won't work.
Hint: this is the directory where this file you are reading is.


Required files
--------------
To make the installer, you also need to have, in the same gtk\win32 directory, the following
files:
 * bmaps.client
 * crossfire.base
 * crossfire.clsc

Those files are bitmaps, to avoid having to download all from server.
But how they are generated, right now that's a mystery ^.^;;;
(this is on my todo/tocheck list)


How to build
------------
Simply launch nsis, specifying gtkclient.nsi as .nsi file:

 makensis gtkclient.nsi

If everything works fine, you'll have a 'crossfire-client-windows.exe' installer.


Troubleshooting
---------------
If something fails, check you did everything as this file says.
If still no go, either:
* check Sourceforge's bug page, http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13833&atid=113833
* check the messageboard, http://www.metalforge.net/cfmb

If you report a problem, paste the output of the makensis command. This will make it easier
to spot issues.
