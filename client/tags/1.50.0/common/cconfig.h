/* Set to default server you want the client to connect to.  This can
 * be especially useful if your installing the client binary on a LAN
 * and want people to just be able to run it without options and connect
 * to some server.  localhost is the default.  Remember to use double
 * quotes around your server name.
 * Comment this out - by default, things connect to metaserver so
 * this is normally ignored in any case.  If this is not commented out,
 * the the client will automatically try to connect to this - useful
 * if inside a firewall and have a local server.  Using -server ""
 * can then bypass this setting

/* Server to contact to get information about crossfire servers.
 * This is not the server you play on, but rather a central repository
 * that lists the servers.
 * METASERVER controls default behaviour (same as -metaserver options) -
 * if set to TRUE, we try to get metaserver information, if false, we do
 * not.  If you are behind a firewall, you probably want this off by
 * default.
 * METASERVER2 is controlled via --disable-metaserver2 when configure
 * is run - by default, it is enabled.

 * performance problems, this may be a more useful way to see
 * what your performance really is like.  The data will be dumped
 * to stderr, with timings in microseconds.  A general rule of thumb
 * is you want the update times to be less than 100,000 microseconds
