---------------------------------------------------
This document details changes between Win32 GTK client releases.
A full log of changes can be found in the 'ChangeLog.rtf' file ('Full change log' in start menu).



From version 1.60.2
-------------------
* GTK runtime bundled right into Crossfire directory, no need for a separate GTK install on the PATH
* SDL and OpenGL not included
* Built with MinGW instead of MSVC
* Removed gtkclient.nsi as it is now generated dynamically by Bundle.py from gtkclient.nsi.in

From versions 1.50.0
------------------
 * The windows client is now the gtk-v2 client, this has been in development over the last few releases, 
   and is now the only one that is now supported (jxclient is also supported, but is a separate sub-project).

Major features to note in gtk-v2
 
* Account-based logins for new servers
* Support for multiple layouts
* More sophisticated message handling options
