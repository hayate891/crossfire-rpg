The original gtk-v2.glade file by Mark Wedel was the basis for the following
layout files.  In fact, all layouts for the GTK-v2 client must contain the
basic widget set found in that work.

- gtk-v2.glade          This layout defaults to use of a 25x25 map.  The
                        default layout size is configured to 1201x1010.  The
                        map itself takes up most of a 1280x1024 screen, and it
                        seems somewhat difficult to use at this resolution and
                        lower.  Stat bars reside in the lower left; stat tables
                        share a tabbed notebook in the lower middle.  Message
                        panes share a tab notebook in the upper right, with
                        inventory and ground views making up the reset of the
                        left hand side of the window.

- dialogs.glade         This file contains all of the ancilliary dialogs used
                        by the GTK V2 client.  Alternative layouts are not
                        provided.

The conversion of the client to support libglade came shortly after Kevin
Bulgrien began developing experimental alternative layouts by copying and
modifying the original gtk-v2.glade layout. Some of those initial layouts
are are found in the following files:

- caelestis.glade       A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        for character and skill/experience data sits above map
                        views beneath. To the top left is a three tab notebook
                        for core stats, critical messages, and protections. At
                        the lower left is the messages pane with entry box.
                        The default window setting supports an 19x22 map pane
                        with an overall size of 1275x945.

- chthonic.glade        A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        holds the map views above a notebook for character and
                        skill/experience data.  To the top left is the critical
                        message box with the standard message box and command
                        input below.  The bottom left corner two tab notebook
                        houses protections and core statistics.  The default
                        window setting supports an 19x22 map pane with an
                        overall size of 1275x945.

- eureka.glade          A U-shaped layout with inventory and ground views at
                        the top and middle left, a critical and regular
                        message area at the top and middle right, with status
                        bars on the bottom left alongside a three tab notebook
                        for core stats, skills & experience, and protections.
                        The map pane is in the middle of the window and may be
                        set for 17x22 tiles at the default 1180x925 settings.

- gtk-v1.glade          An approximation of the original GTK client layout.
                        A 17x16 map pane fits well on the default 1180x925
                        window size.

- lobotomy.glade        A layout of a slightly different persuasion.  This one
                        sports a map layout on the left.  To the right sit the
                        inventory/ground view and message panes.  Underscoring
                        this unconventional view sit the stat bars and tabbed
                        notebook common to many of these layouts.  The window
                        defaults are set at 1280x925, and sport a map pane of
                        19x22.

- meflin.glade          A player-suggested modification of an experimental
                        layout.  Send in a suggestion, and you might have a
                        layout tuned to your tastes.  Presently a map view
                        notebook is at top right with message, inventory, and
                        ground views sharing a tabbed notebook to the left.
                        At the bottom rest the stat bars and a three tab
                        notebook for character data.  This one is custom-sized
                        at 1233x1001, and at these settings, fits a healthy
                        sized 25x25 map view.

                        Send in a suggestion for a layout, and if you're nice
                        about it, the author will likely be able to whip one up
                        to suit your individual tastes.  For that matter, SVN
                        contains tips on how to roll your own...

- oroboros.glade        A layout designed for 1024x768 desktops.  On the left
                        are a tabbed message window, inventory, and floor view.
                        To the right, at the top is a four tab notebook that
                        contains all of the character statistics, and below it
                        is the map view.  At 1024x768, the map view is 20x13.
                        Since oroboros makes heavy use of tabbed notebooks, it
                        is also appropriate for those that prefer to see less
                        information simultaneously on screen.

- un-deux.glade         It is still vaguely reminiscent of the original GTK V1
                        client.  The inventory and ground view are to the right
                        and use the full window height.  The message pane,
                        command entry box and the critical message pane are on
                        the left, also occupying the full window height.  The
                        middle of the screen consists of a tab notebook for
                        core stats and skills, then another notebook for the
                        map and magic map display, followed by the status bars
                        and protections list.  The window size defaults to
                        1180x925 and comfortably handles a 19x18 map pane.

- v1-redux.glade        A slight improvement on the original GTK client layout
                        with a tab notebook above the map view that switches
                        between the character and skills information.  This
                        helps reduce the vertical space constraints.  The
                        default window positions fit 1280x1024 or 1400x1050
                        screens with room to spare for side or bottom panels.
                        A 19x17 map pane fits well on the default 1180x925
                        window size.
