Readme for Crossfire's GTK client under Windows (May, 19th, 2010)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This document contains notes and information about running Crossfire's GTK client under Win32.
More information about Crossfire can be found at http://crossfire.real-time.com

Building instructions can be found in Building.txt, located in the same directory.
Changes from previous versions are listed in 'Changes' or 'Full change log' files from
start menu.


This is release 1.60.2 of the client, only the GTK-v2 client is supported or maintained in 
any way.

Requirements
------------
The client requires GTK libraries to run, these are included in the installer.

GTK Warning
-----------
People have reported many issues with GTK. If you experience any trouble, before asking for
help, check http://www.metalforge.net/cfmb/, the 'bugs' and/or 'Spoilers and help request'
forums.

Installation
------------
Note: if you installed via an installer, you can skip this section.

The client can run from any directory.
A .crossfire directory will be created to store settings and cached images.
If the environment variable 'HOME' is set, .crossfire will be created as $HOME/.crossfire
Else your application's directory will be used.

Release notes & known issues
----------------------------
* There is no sound currently.
* The config dialogs don't work properly, some settings can still be changed, others will 
  require the gdefaults2 file to be edited directly.
* The client isn't built with OpenGL support enabled, it does have SDL support.

Display Options
---------------

This version of the client supports SDL and OpenGL rendering, but it makes no attempt to 
detect which one is best for your system.  It's strongly recommended that, before playing 
for the first time, you open the configuration dialog (main menu, "Client", "Configure") 
and change a few settings to your liking.  In particular, "Enable smoothing", and on 
"Display mode", select OpenGL.  Save and restart (the client, not your system).  If your
map display doesn't work or has artifacts, configure again and select SDL.

If using SDL and if your computer is relatively recent, you should also set the 
"Lighting options" to "Best Per Pixel".

Finally, if you installed the extra layouts, you may want to try a few of them.  
Changing layouts requires a client restart.
