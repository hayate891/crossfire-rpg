Changes for Win32 GTK client 1.9.1, august 2008, 04
---------------------------------------------------

This document details changes between Win32 GTK client releases.
A full log of changes can be found in the 'ChangeLog.rtf' file ('Full change log' in start menu).

Note: SVN now has 2 distinct code bases, "trunk" and "1.x". First is
what will become the future 2.0 version, and includes changes that could
make it incompatible with 1.x versions. Second is the legacy branch, which
should only contain bugfixes and small improvements.
This snapshot is based on the trunk.
