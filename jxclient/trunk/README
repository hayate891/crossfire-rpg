Project description:
--------------------
JXClient is a client for Crossfire (http://crossfire.real-time.com/).

Requires:
---------
- Sun JVM 1.6.x or higher;
- At least 384MB of memory;

Recommended:
------------
- Sun JVM 1.6.0 or higher;
- Driver-level support for hardware accelerated operations
  (Either OpenGL or DirectX, depending on your system).

Fullscreen support:
-------------------
JXClient uses the fullscreen support provided by the JVM.

Although the client will switch to windowed mode if real fullscreen is not
available, it is important to note that accelerated support will probably end up
being disabled.

You can download an updated version from either http://www.java.com
or from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp .

To check if the graphical operations are accelerated, you can add
"-Dsun.java2d.trace=log,timestamp,count,out:java2d.log" to your JVM command
line, run the client, then check the content of java2d.log.

Compiling the sources:
----------------------
Run "./gradlew" (or gradlew on Windows) to build the client. This first
downloads Gradle (http://www.gradle.org), then builds the client.

If your Internet connection requires a proxy try one of the following:

    ./gradlew -DsocksProxyHost=... -DsocksProxyPort=...
    ./gradlew -Dhttp.proxyHost=... -Dhttp.proxyPort=...

You need the proxy only during the first build. Afterwards no further Internet
access is needed.

If you have more than one Java version installed, you can select the right
version with

    JAVA_HOME=/.../jdk1.6.0_21 ./gradlew

or

    SET JAVA_HOME=\...\jdk1.6.0_21
    gradlew

on Windows.

Run the client with "java -jar jxclient.jar".

Connecting through a proxy:
---------------------------
Set an HTTP proxy to allow metaserver access to retrieve the list of available
game servers:

    java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.hostname and -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -jar jxclient.jar

or, alternatively,

    export http_proxy=http://proxy.hostname:8080/
    java -jar jxclient.jar

Set a SOCKS proxy for connection to game servers:

    java -DsocksProxyHost=proxy.hostname -DsocksProxyPort=1080 -jar jxclient.jar
