This document documents differences of the scripting interface compared to the
GTK-v2 client.

The "request stat" supports two more subtypes:

 * The command

     request stat stats_race

   returns

     request stat stats_race STR CON DEX INT WIS POW CHA

   for the race's maximum values.

 * The command

     request stat stats_base

   returns

     request stat stats_base STR CON DEX INT WIS POW CHA

   for the base stat values without applied boosts or depletions.

 * The command

     request stat stats_applied

   returns

     request stat stats_applied STR CON DEX INT WIS POW CHA

   for the stat differences due to applied gear or skills.

    str_base   current strength without applied boosts or depletions
