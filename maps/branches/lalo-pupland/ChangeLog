	  The Avatars (created by the generators) were a little too fast

	* : Import missing maps and updated map paths for exits and
	  entrances. Cosmetic changes in regards to how 'swall' merged with
	  adjacent walls. Removed missing or unused archetypes. Other
	  changes are due to map editor reformatting.

	  with icestorm. Other changes are due to map editor reformatting.

	* : Renamed maps (which were either unnamed, used the actual file
	  name or tweaked their spelling and capitilization). Corrected
	  wall sections there were 'incorrect' and obvious when next to
	  doorways or similar openings - basically using the wrong wall

	* : Cosmetic changes to the Sport Center - added missing floor
	  tiles under the trapdoors where monsters are generated. Re-linked
	  the levers to the trap doors. This map will have to be watched
	  closely for balance issues *and* for possible map camping or
	  similar abuse - it's design is very similar to the old Training
	  Centers. Some cleanup remains as many of the trapdoors are using
	  old(?) connection references.

2007-02-21 02:10  rjtanner

	* : Fixed the broken path error for the Sport Center, it's now
	  accessible again.

2007-02-20 01:35  rjtanner

	  the wrong location in the shop.

	* : Reduced the damage of the shocking rune from 40 down to 15 as
	  this trap was very deadly for low level players. Renamed the map
	  to accurately reflect the world map name. Other changes are due
	  to Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-20 00:54  rjtanner

	* : Inventory sign does not list items in bookshelves. Removing the
	  sign from the shop.

2007-02-20 00:53  rjtanner

	  generating skeletons. I missed updating the 'breed monster'
	  field.

2007-02-19 05:44  rjtanner

	* : Massive checkin. Went through many, many maps and updated their
	  names (which were either unnamed, used the actual file name or
	  tweaked their spelling and capitilization). Corrected wall
	  sections there were 'incorrect' and obvious when next to doorways
	  or similar openings - basically using the wrong wall sections.
	  Minor cosmetic updates to maps as well. Other changes are due to
	  Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:21  rjtanner

	* : Replaced the skeleton generator with a zombie generator as it
	  apears skeletons are too difficult for players under level 5 or
	  6. Added some windows to the inner wall sections for easier
	  visability of monsters for new players. The centipede is another
	  source that is the cause of frequent deaths - but is still
	  available for now. Other changes are due to Map Editor
	  reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:18  rjtanner

	  match more closely the appearance on the outside. Also added an
	  inventory inside the shop entrance. Renamed the map from

2007-02-19 05:15  rjtanner

	* : Significant cosmetic changes to this map - added cave walls and
	  similar sections to the map to give it an 'underground
	  appearance' instead of portions of the map appearing to be
	  blocked by nothing but darkness. Other changes are Map Editor
	  reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:12  rjtanner

	* : Skud Tower was surrounded my mountain tiles that were
	  impossible to pass by any means available to players, made a
	  small change (made a mountain tile 'passable') so people can once
	  again access this map. Other changes are Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:11  rjtanner

	* : Added missing floor tiles to the Castle Zaah maps. Cosmetic
	  touchups for sections of walls next to doors - wrong wall
	  sections are used. Other changes are Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:08  rjtanner

	* : Made the Sport Center available again in Brest. Also updated
	  maps files in Brest to better match the actual map name (vs
	  unnamed or the file name.) Other changes are Map Editor
	  reformatting.

	* : Minor cosmetic changes to brest/zorn/castle.basement0
	  Fix "emergency exit".
	  Move a wall.

2007-02-13 02:24  rjtanner

2007-02-12 03:30  kbulgrien

	  - Minor line break change in text.

2007-02-12 03:20  kbulgrien

	  breaks.

	  consistent colors on various pup_land maps when using the base
	  tile set.

	* : Missed including world_104_115 (shop area of Scorn) in previous
	  commit. RJT, Feb-03-2007

2007-02-03 07:12  rjtanner

	* : Fixed '0 destination coordinates' error with Mosely's Magic
	  Books, which also required destination (shop entrance) updates to
	  world_104_115 (shop area of Scorn). Cosmetic updates for the book
	  store as well. Be sure to remove world_104_115 from the
	  unique-file directory when updating. RJT, Feb-03-2007

2007-02-03 05:38  rjtanner

	* : Removed exits from the HallofSelection maps, which allowed
	  players to skip the Class Selection step, since beginner players
	  no longer return there upon death - they go to the Nexus instead.
	  This also prevents new players from skipping the Class Selection
	  step and ending up with a character with minimum skills and
	  abilities. RJT, Feb-02-2007

2007-02-03 04:35  rjtanner

	* : Add altars for all cults and two 'test' altars to HallOfDMs ...
	  because DMs might need to pray too.
	  
	  Since HallOfDMs has unique tiles the unique file will need to be
	  removed for this update to apply correctly. Be sure to move any
	  stuff off the map that needs to be kept before removing the
	  unique file.

2007-01-01 00:27  eracc

	* : Fixup the NPCs a bit to make them not so difficult after some

	* : Misc tests.

2006-12-23 16:26  eracc

2006-12-20 23:27  eracc

	* : Fix the map to prevent players from becoming trapped inside the
	  gates.

2006-12-20 21:02  eracc

	  Let's try this commit again after having to update the entire map
	  tree thanks to Rednaxela.
	  
	  Update to Zorn Castle floor two. New modified monsters and some
	  generators added. Also mods to the floor plan. The exits to the
	  towers and to the top floor do not yet work. This floor is
	  basically "finished" and playable.

2006-12-12 05:45  eracc

	* : Ok, so the spell I picked for Gorokh's rod in the treasure room

	* : Added one more item dropped by Advocate of Gorokh and built the

	  the entrance to the final map a bit safer for the initial visit.

2006-12-12 00:26  eracc

	  too fast.

2006-12-11 22:49  eracc

	* : Fix a problem with the monster generators.

2006-12-11 22:18  eracc

	  tiles were blocking the generators unfortunately.

2006-12-11 21:45  eracc

	* : Of course the look was not exactly what I wanted, so I changed
	  it. New look and other map modifications for gorokh_final with
	  this commit.

2006-12-10 21:41  eracc

	* : Forgot to set the difficulty level on the gorokh_final map.
	  Fixed.

2006-12-10 21:35  eracc

2006-12-10 21:28  eracc

	  indestructible.

2006-11-20 18:35  eracc

	* : Update the LTAp shared courtyard with a few "invisible" lights
	  since it is now an outdoor map. Would be nice to be able to make
	  specific tiles outdoor tiles ...

2006-11-14 16:36  eracc

	* : Make the shared courtyard an outdoor map ... since it is
	  supposed to be outdoors.

2006-11-13 23:48  eracc

	* : Modify Ascended Vicar of Valriel to try to get the stupid
	  monster to CAST a prayer without using a rod. (grumble)

2006-11-13 22:40  eracc

	* : Remove the scroll of snares (set traps) because the skill is
	  unimplemented at this time. Will put it back if the skill becomes
	  useful.

	  likely too low to ever cast the spell.

2006-11-12 19:42  eracc

	* : Per suggestions by various people there is now a treasure room

2006-11-11 17:10  eracc

	* : Tweak the boss monster a bit to make it possible for a high

	* wolfsburg/eeur/tower1.4: Hide diamonds below earthwalls.

2006-11-09 19:30  akirschbaum

	* scorn/houses/newhouse1: Hide Gate Pass below earthwall.

2006-11-08 23:17  eracc

	* : The Room Attendants were set to "stand still" which made them a
	  little too easy in my opinion. This is changed with this version
	  of the map. Did the same for the Senior Room Attendants. Also
	  rearranged the NPCs to be between braziers when possible to make
	  it harder to simply run through them.

2006-11-05 02:57  eracc

	* : Add another cute little critter in Zorn castle.

2006-11-05 02:40  eracc

	* : Several updates to Zorn castle.upper.floor.one to fix traps and
	  fix some items carried by NPCs. Also reduce the number of
	  Zerina's Sea Trunks and add a Zerina's Sea Chest. Added traps for
	  both.

2006-11-03 15:04  eracc

	* : Make a few more changes to Zorn castle first upper floor.
	  Change some of the traps and modify Yolanda, Zerina and the
	  personal guards to make them faster and more dangerous.

2006-11-03 00:48  eracc

	* : Made an error with Zerina's dagger. One of the attack types is
	  supposed to be cold, not confusion. Fixed.

2006-11-02 19:21  eracc

	* : Minor modifications to allow possessors of Zorn's key to get
	  into the back area through a garden gate. IIRC I did not actually
	  change brest.scrolls.right but since it showed up as changed in
	  "trunk" when I first started to commit I went ahead and copied it
	  to "1.x" just in case I did change it and can't remember.

2006-11-02 18:50  eracc

	* : Add a check_inv tile to block players that do not have the

	  - Furniture and characters moved throughout map so that standing
	  by
	  one NPC and talking only gets a response from the NPC closest to
	  the player. Previously several NPCs answered when they were not
	  the closest NPC to the player.
	  - Character msg/endmsg text changes: redundant match strings
	  removed;
	  line wrapping removed. Minor formatting/spelling/grammar changes.
	  - Dilek: msg/endmsg refers to empty booze bottle on table, but
	  none
	  was there. Added an empty booze bottle to Dilek's table.
	  - BRAGH O'LEARY: Add match strings job and name to make it more
	  likely
	  that someone can eke conversation out of him. By default he was
	  so
	  standoffish you might not keep trying to chat with him. His booze
	  is fixed to now render on top of, instead of under, the table.
	  - West-wall wizard in red garb: One of his hints relates to the
	  Pirate
	  Den that moved to Wolfsburg. Adjusted the "easy" magic ear
	  message
	  to mention Wolfsburg in that part of the text. Also added name
	  and
	  job match strings.
	  - Wizard with an aura of great power: Added match string message
	  for
	  job and name.
	  - Slot machines had "slaying" without a target value.
	  CFJavaEditor
	  removed the lines.
	  - Bingo room table/altar on same coordinates were split up to put
	  the
	  table back in the middle line of tables.
	  - Dwarf lumberjack: Now has a "name".
	  - Mark, 1st Tier warrior, dwarf miner, beholder, dwarf
	  lumberjack,
	  wounded fighter, pirate, pupland elves, conjurer, emissary: Added
	  name and/or job matches.
	  - Reworked pupland elf's conversation a bit.
	  - Brum talked about the Black Ice mountains, but there are no
	  other
	  references to them by that name, so now he tells you where they
	  are.

	  enchanges
	  of currency to platinum. Added a cleanup routine in the
	  python_remove script to delete account when players quit.
	  A transaction fee was implemented for deposits (default 5%)
	  requires use of new arch "imperial" (bank notes with no
	  intrinsic value)

2003-09-21 07:03  temitchell

	* : - changes to the sylvan styles and minor changes to the wall
	  styles that
	  are not 'autojoining' type. For some reason these walls do not
	  retain
	  some of their properties (e.g. blocks view). The code should
	  probably
	  also be tweeked to handle single arch wall objects better (or at
	  least
	  for simple walls - escape the wall joining routine and not to
	  send out
	  all those log errors for non-existant arches).
	  Walls for random maps should not have smoothing either...

	  walls -

	  work this
	  - patch forthcoming)

	* : - add a couple things to the styles like special doors for
	  sylvan maps
	  and a wall file for making hedge mazes
	  
	  tweek some existing styles

	  he's
	  likely to have seen lots of people.

2003-07-25 05:27  temitchell

	* : - breaking out seen into it's own script, the bank stuff into
	  it's own
	  script and removing the part if the seen command that hands out
	  players
	  IP addresses to other players.

2003-07-21 01:01  temitchell

	  to enter Brittany.
	  
	  Additionally I added a direct road to Lake Country.
	  I have also replaced all wastelands inside Brittany by

	* : - making newbie annex in scorn. New players will now appear on
	  worlds_105_116 4 4. Moved some lower level maps and the free inn
	  to
	  accommodate. A couple new maps heavy on the training would be
	  good
	  here. This area is not entirely for low levels (the new river way
	  looks good for a sewer
	  adventure) but should cater to new players. Scorn central square
	  has
	  been made more snappy too.
	  There may be some loose ends to tie up (the signage should be
	  redone a
	  bit) and I'll get on that post haste.
