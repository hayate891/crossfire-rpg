	  objects to use inventory objects.

2007-11-04 07:50  rjtanner

	* world/world_107_128: Remove links to non-existant maps (or maps
	  that are still in /unlinked)

2007-11-04 07:20  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/jones: Make the trap on the treasure chest less
	  deadly for new players - removed the spikes trap and set a fixed
	  damage amount on the rune of shocking

2007-11-04 07:08  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/maze1: Merge existing changes from trunk; make Fun
	  House map a little more friendly to new players by replacing the
	  skeletons with zombies, then reducing the number of initial
	  zombies by 2 and also only having one zombie generator

2007-11-04 06:50  rjtanner

	* scorn/temples/valriel2: Added no_magic tiles to the swall section
	  so players can not use dimension door to enter this section -
	  it's intent is to give a balcony-like appearance to the level
	  instead of it being an actual part of the map

2007-11-04 06:28  rjtanner

	* pup_land/rainbow/Lv1/cage: Tentative fix for bug # [ 1735463 ]
	  Rainbow island quest traps player - set up a boulder and button
	  combo to reset the trap door on a timer or when a player is moved
	  to a transition area before going to the next map; found that the
	  goblins were somehow appearing in areas of the map they shouldn't
	  once the map was full of them so I removed the generators and
	  just added a fixed number of goblins

2007-11-03 22:57  rjtanner

	* darcap/darcap/circus/wurfbude: Tentative fix for bug # [1805174]
	  /darcap/darcap/circus/wurfbude Exit teleporter broken - fixed
	  coordinates on a number of teleporters and removed movement
	  detectors on the exit teleporter, added entrance coordinates to
	  make bug testing easier

2007-11-03 20:28  rjtanner

	* dragonisland/advguild2: Change so that the monster standing next
	  to the altars do not move (often, standing over the altars) -
	  change facing for Nathirel so he's 'looking at you' instead of
	  looking at the wall

2007-11-03 20:18  rjtanner

	* port_joseph/town/underground_tavern: Update map difficulty, and
	  arrange stacking order so that the platters appear on top of the
	  tables vs under then

2007-11-03 02:47  rjtanner

	* pup_land/ancient/castle/gothwolte.2: Added missing face/graphic
	  for confusion

2007-11-03 02:26  rjtanner

	* navar_city/misc/midane: Add missing map difficulty, remove the
	  wallclock archetype from branch/1.x since it's not available in
	  the branch archetype set

2007-11-03 02:02  rjtanner

	* lake_country/Butakis/houses/Jacobs_house,
	  lake_country/Butakis/houses/James_house,
	  lake_country/Butakis/luck3: Replace old and broken monster
	  abilities with current abilities or spells, typo and text spacing
	  corrections

2007-11-03 01:36  rjtanner

	* euthville/demon_quest: Replace old and broken monster abilities
	  (ability_fire) with current fire based abilities (burning hands,
	  medium fireball, create fire wall)

2007-11-03 01:27  rjtanner

	* lake_country/Butakis/luck1: Update old and broken monster
	  abilities to match current spell abilities and improve their
	  resistances so their own spells do not kill them

2007-11-03 00:16  rjtanner

	* darcap/lynn/castle1.0: Remove unholy_ground from beneath altars
	  now that their (re)consecrate level was set to level 120

2007-03-20 20:59  eracc

	* brest/amphis: Remove extra space in some monster names. Fix all
	  walls to look consistent.

2007-03-20 05:01  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq, templates/guild/guild_jeweler,
	  templates/guild/guild_thaum, templates/guild/guild_toolshed,
	  templates/guild/secondfloor: Made the Jeweler and Thaumaturgy
	  areas a stand alone map. This should improve the chances of the
	  map actually resetting to remove any broken or cursed workbenches
	  or desks if they should appear during normal player use. Also
	  made the decoration items sitting on tables for each map
	  no_pickup.

2007-03-19 23:39  eracc

	* pup_land/lone_town/bank: Update the Lone Town bank with a
	  slightly more bank-like look and new jade and
	  amberium conversion tables.

2007-03-19 17:15  eracc

	* brest/shops/a_small_shop: It appears the mana charging crystal
	  would *always* cause one's head to explode
	  in a fireball. This is not intended. Reduced the number of
	  transferrence walls
	  to try to control this effect.

2007-03-18 21:58  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two: Trying to fix my "earth to
	  dust" bullet wall that triggers when the alarm goes.

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Reduced the level of banish to
	  not instantly kill devourers.

2007-03-18 18:51  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Devourer players have it too easy
	  with no monsters attacking them with banish.
	  This update should make the devourer life more ... interesting on
	  these maps.

2007-03-18 00:08  ryo_saeba

	* test/python, test/python.py, test/python_exit.py: More Python
	  tests.

2007-03-17 07:33  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_toolshed, templates/guild/mainfloor: Made
	  the Guild Tool Shed a stand alone map. This should improve the
	  chances of the map actually resetting to remove any broken or
	  cursed forges or workbenches if they should appear during normal
	  player use. Also had to update the Guild Main Floor map to link
	  to the new Tool Shed map.

2007-03-17 07:22  rjtanner

	* euthville/magic.shop: Cosmetic update in how the fence (swall)
	  merges with nearby walls - essentially the small gap is removed

2007-03-17 07:18  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq: Updating the map header to take credit
	  (or blame) for this map

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq, templates/guild/mainfloor: Cosmetic
	  updates to the guild template main floor (swall surrounding the
	  bbq area). Change in functionality with the guild bbq - now a
	  stand alone map. This should improve the chances of the bbq map
	  actually resetting to remove any broken or cursed stoves if they
	  should appear during normal player use.

	  something more specific. Other changes are due to Map Editor
	  reformatting.

	* azumauindo/minatomachi/ketsueki_itsuryuu/ground: Remove stray
	  text message.

	* ChangeLog: Used svn2cl to regenerate the ChangeLog file for Trunk
	  map changes to include a full and thorough history of the
	  changes.

2007-02-21 03:31  rjtanner

	* brest/sport.jess: Cosmetic changes to the Sport Center - added
	  missing floor tiles under the trapdoors where monsters are
	  generated. Re-linked the levers to the trap doors. This map will
	  have to be watched closely for balance issues *and* for possible
	  map camping or similar abuse - it's design is very similar to the
	  old Training Centers. Some cleanup remains as many of the
	  trapdoors are using old(?) connection references.

2007-02-21 02:10  rjtanner

	* world/world_107_123: Fixed the broken path error for the Sport
	  Center, it's now accessible again.

2007-02-20 01:35  rjtanner

	* world/world_109_126: Updated the entrance coordinates from Lake
	  Country world map to Mopoon's Weapon shop, as my earlier fix
	  'dropped' the player at the wrong location in the shop.

2007-02-20 01:02  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/jones: Reduced the damage of the shocking rune from
	  40 down to 15 as this trap was very deadly for low level players.
	  Renamed the map to accurately reflect the world map name. Other
	  changes are due to Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-20 00:54  rjtanner

	* scorn/shops/BasicSpells: Inventory sign does not list items in
	  bookshelves. Removing the sign from the shop.

2007-02-20 00:53  rjtanner

	* scorn/misc/beginners2: Corrected error with the zombie generator
	  - it was still generating skeletons. I missed updating the 'breed
	  monster' field.

	  Massive checkin. Went through many, many maps and updated their
	  names (which were either unnamed, used the actual file name or
	  tweaked their spelling and capitilization). Corrected wall
	  sections there were 'incorrect' and obvious when next to doorways
	  or similar openings - basically using the wrong wall sections.
	  Minor cosmetic updates to maps as well. Other changes are due to
	  Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:21  rjtanner

	* scorn/misc/beginners2: Replaced the skeleton generator with a
	  zombie generator as it apears skeletons are too difficult for
	  players under level 5 or 6. Added some windows to the inner wall
	  sections for easier visability of monsters for new players. The
	  centipede is another source that is the cause of frequent deaths
	  - but is still available for now. Other changes are due to Map
	  Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:18  rjtanner

	* scorn/shops/BasicSpells: Significant cosmetic changes to this map
	  in order to make it match more closely the appearance on the
	  outside. Also added an inventory inside the shop entrance.
	  Renamed the map from BasicSpells to Moseleys Magic Books.

2007-02-19 05:15  rjtanner

	* lake_country/shops/Mopoon_wshop: Significant cosmetic changes to
	  this map - added cave walls and similar sections to the map to
	  give it an 'underground appearance' instead of portions of the
	  map appearing to be blocked by nothing but darkness. Other
	  changes are Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:12  rjtanner

	* world/world_120_116: Skud Tower was surrounded my mountain tiles
	  that were impossible to pass by any means available to players,
	  made a small change (made a mountain tile 'passable') so people
	  can once again access this map. Other changes are Map Editor
	  reformatting.

	  - Minor line break change in text.

2007-02-12 03:20  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/lone_town/magic: - Primary reason for edit is to add

	  - Reformatted various conversation texts to remove spurious line
	  breaks.
	  - Remove redundant match strings (mixed case match strings not

	  consistent colors on various pup_land maps when using the base

	  the
	  server. The sea.arc file has applicable edits to enable

	* dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_treasure: Ok, so the spell I picked for
	  Gorokh's rod in the treasure room was a bad idea. I picked a new
	  one and here is the updated maps.

2006-12-12 03:56  eracc

	* dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_treasure:
	  Added one more item dropped by Advocate of Gorokh and built the

	  the entrance to the final map a bit safer for the initial visit.

2006-12-12 00:26  eracc

	  generators.

2006-12-11 22:18  eracc

2006-12-11 21:45  eracc

	* dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final: Of course the look was not exactly
	  what I wanted, so I changed it. New look and other map

	  the new final map.

2006-12-10 21:28  eracc

	* dungeons/gorokh, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final: You knew it was
	  coming. A final map for Gorokh random starting from the temple in
	  Scorn. This part is pretty much finished. The treasure room has
	  yet to be created but is coming soon.

2006-12-04 21:29  akirschbaum

	* quests/todd/aljwaf/crypt6: Add handle to allow players to escape

	  can be opened, by making boxes indestructible.

2006-11-20 18:35  eracc

	* pup_land/lone_town/apartment/sharedcourtyard: Update the LTAp
	  shared courtyard with a few "invisible" lights since it is now an
	  outdoor map. Would be nice to be able to make specific tiles
	  outdoor tiles ...

2006-11-14 16:36  eracc

	* pup_land/lone_town/apartment/sharedcourtyard: Make the shared
	  courtyard an outdoor map ... since it is supposed to be outdoors.

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Modify Ascended Vicar of Valriel
	  to try to get the stupid monster to CAST a prayer without using a
	  rod. (grumble)

2006-11-13 22:40  eracc

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_treasure: Remove the scroll of snares
	  (set traps) because the skill is unimplemented at this time. Will
	  put it back if the skill becomes useful.

2006-11-12 21:00  eracc

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_treasure: Fix amount of max spellpoints
	  in Valriel's Holy Scepter. Was likely too low to ever cast the
	  spell.

2006-11-12 19:42  eracc

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_final,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_treasure: Per suggestions by various
	  people there is now a treasure room for Valriel random. It is
	  accessible with a key after defeating the hard to kill Ascended
	  Vicar of Valriel who drops said key.

2006-11-11 17:10  eracc

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Tweak the boss monster a bit to
	  make it possible for a high level dragon attack. Also add another
	  item to be dropped by the boss.

2006-11-11 04:12  eracc

	* dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Adjust the High Retributioners
	  with a High Angel treasure list so they will drop good dragon

	  brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two: Add the entrance code to get
	  to castle.upper.floor.two from castle.upper.floor.one and begin
	  creation of castle.upper.floor.two for the continuation of the
	  Zorn Scrolls Quest.

2006-11-10 03:27  eracc

2006-11-09 19:39  akirschbaum

2006-11-09 19:30  akirschbaum

	* scorn/houses/newhouse1: Hide Gate Pass below earthwall.

2006-11-08 23:17  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: The Room Attendants were set
	  to "stand still" which made them a little too easy in my opinion.
	  This is changed with this version of the map. Did the same for
	  the Senior Room Attendants. Also rearranged the NPCs to be
	  between braziers when possible to make it harder to simply run
	  through them.

2006-11-05 02:57  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: Add another cute little
	  critter in Zorn castle.

2006-11-05 02:40  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: Traps in this map were still
	  not working the way I expected. Trying something different.

2006-11-04 21:56  eracc

	  castle.upper.floor.one to fix traps and fix some items carried by
	  NPCs. Also reduce the number of Zerina's Sea Trunks and add a
	  Zerina's Sea Chest. Added traps for both.

2006-11-03 15:04  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: Make a few more changes to
	  Zorn castle first upper floor. Change some of the traps and
	  modify Yolanda, Zerina and the personal guards to make them
	  faster and more dangerous.

2006-11-03 00:48  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: Made an error with Zerina's

	  save in CFJavaEditor.
	  - Furniture and characters moved throughout map so that standing

	  the closest NPC to the player.
	  - Character msg/endmsg text changes: redundant match strings
	  removed;
	  line wrapping removed. Minor formatting/spelling/grammar changes.
	  - Dilek: msg/endmsg refers to empty booze bottle on table, but
	  none
	  was there. Added an empty booze bottle to Dilek's table.
	  - BRAGH O'LEARY: Add match strings job and name to make it more
	  likely
	  that someone can eke conversation out of him. By default he was
	  so
	  standoffish you might not keep trying to chat with him. His booze
	  is fixed to now render on top of, instead of under, the table.
	  - West-wall wizard in red garb: One of his hints relates to the
	  Pirate
	  Den that moved to Wolfsburg. Adjusted the "easy" magic ear
	  message
	  to mention Wolfsburg in that part of the text. Also added name
	  and
	  job match strings.
	  - Wizard with an aura of great power: Added match string message
	  for
	  job and name.
	  - Slot machines had "slaying" without a target value.
	  CFJavaEditor
	  removed the lines.
	  - Bingo room table/altar on same coordinates were split up to put
	  the
	  table back in the middle line of tables.
	  - Dwarf lumberjack: Now has a "name".
	  - Mark, 1st Tier warrior, dwarf miner, beholder, dwarf
	  lumberjack,
	  wounded fighter, pirate, pupland elves, conjurer, emissary: Added
	  name and/or job matches.
	  - Reworked pupland elf's conversation a bit.
	  - Brum talked about the Black Ice mountains, but there are no
	  other
	  references to them by that name, so now he tells you where they
	  are.

	  game day
	  AFAIK)

2003-10-27 06:22  temitchell

	* : - change the marker time for access to approximate a game day
	  (5040
	  seconds or 1.4
	  hours by my poor estimation).

2003-10-27 04:35  temitchell

	* : - change these to use trigger_markers to insert a time expiring
	  force -
	  this allows personal access to the caldrons for an hour (360 food
	  = ~1hour) for 200 platinum
	  coins - after which time you have to pay again.

2003-10-27 03:22  temitchell

	* : - oops fix the gate at the end so it closes. I am thinking this
	  might
	  make a good unique map perhaps (then you could add some doors and
	  stuff).
	  - add the creator's name to the map info :)

2003-10-27 02:58  temitchell

2003-10-25 02:20  temitchell

	  number of
	  existing items in the same space.
	  (using itemborker to set number of items add or remove as a safer
	  way to
	  manage this.)

	* : - fixes to these maps - grumms inn needed some connect fixes
	  and the
	  stairs were accessable without payment. The bridge over the
	  estuary was
	  not passable (water was no_pass - now passable)

2003-10-12 01:43  temitchell

2003-09-28 21:49  temitchell

	* : - minor change to allow multiple bank databases

	  modular as possible IMHO) and so I did it.
	  Added README from unlinked with changes

2003-09-28 21:12  temitchell

	* : - remove these from unlinked - moving the READMe to the python
	  IPO
	  folder

2003-09-28 21:07  temitchell

	* : - add tellers to these banks hooked to python banking scripts

2003-09-28 16:49  temitchell

	* : - touchups for banking system
	  Bank now uses imperials (1000 gold) for withdrawls and can do
	  enchanges
	  of currency to platinum. Added a cleanup routine in the
	  python_remove script to delete account when players quit.
	  A transaction fee was implemented for deposits (default 5%)
	  requires use of new arch "imperial" (bank notes with no
	  intrinsic value)

2003-09-21 07:03  temitchell

	* : - changes to the sylvan styles and minor changes to the wall
	  styles that
	  are not 'autojoining' type. For some reason these walls do not
	  retain
	  some of their properties (e.g. blocks view). The code should
	  probably
	  also be tweeked to handle single arch wall objects better (or at
	  least
	  for simple walls - escape the wall joining routine and not to
	  send out
	  all those log errors for non-existant arches).
	  Walls for random maps should not have smoothing either...

2003-09-21 01:49  temitchell

	* : - the java editor keeps tricking me and turnig these back to
	  walls -
	  hopefully this is the final time

2003-09-20 22:44  temitchell

	  special door
	  styles. (modifications to the random door code is required to
	  work this
	  - patch forthcoming)

2003-09-20 19:27  temitchell

	* : - add a couple things to the styles like special doors for
	  sylvan maps
	  and a wall file for making hedge mazes
	  
	  tweek some existing styles

2003-09-14 10:50  temitchell

	* : - adding a bridge with (no trolls under it)
	  removing some excess elevation entries

2003-09-14 05:47  temitchell

	* : - add in a few random maps south of scorn, add an orchard
	  backport elevation from old maps and assign some elevations based

	  ground type (groan).

2003-07-25 05:28  temitchell

	* : - hook the fellow at the front door into the seen.py script -
	  he's
	  likely to have seen lots of people.

2003-07-25 05:27  temitchell

	* : - breaking out seen into it's own script, the bank stuff into
	  it's own
	  script and removing the part if the seen command that hands out
	  players
	  IP addresses to other players.

2003-07-21 01:01  temitchell

	  There are two passages where the road leads over the mountains.
	  Players need to fight and survive the mountain tops in order

	  Additionally I added a direct road to Lake Country.
	  I have also replaced all wastelands inside Brittany by

	  to

	  good
	  here. This area is not entirely for low levels (the new river way
	  looks good for a sewer
	  adventure) but should cater to new players. Scorn central square
	  has
	  been made more snappy too.
	  There may be some loose ends to tie up (the signage should be
	  redone a
	  bit) and I'll get on that post haste.

	  worldmap
	  added Hermes Inn between Navar and Scorn
	  added some buildings (unlinked as yet) along the road (and a
	  small mining town near the mountain underpass to darcap)
	  Most worldmaps have not been changed, but are showing up on this
	  list because I swapped mountain2 for mountain4 then back again
	  and this seems to be showing up as a change.

	  for
	  this distribution.
	  world/world_105_115: Fix gatehouse to city to work properly -
