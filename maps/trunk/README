ChangeLog
==============================================================================

The ChangeLog file has been built with svn2cl 0.7 and 0.9 as obtained fromm
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/downloads.html.  Do not use version 0.6
or older as it appears to generate incompatible ChangeLog formats.

These instructions presume an installation of the tarball similar to this.
The actual paths may be different for each developer, but these are used for
sake of example.  There is no requirement to use the example paths.

  $ cd ~
  $ tar -xzf svn2cl-0.9.tar.gz

To update the ChangeLog, a command sequence like this is generally possible
with one caveat.  Do not check in the results without checking the the changes
with svn diff to avoid throwing away someone's comments that are more verbose
than the svn commit comment.

  $ cd /home/data/svn/crossfire/maps/trunk
  $ ~/svn2cl-0.9/svn2cl.sh

The following may be safer, but also may not entirely regenerate missing
entries if manual edits have been made.  Again, never check in updates without
checking differences and merging any manual edits developers may have made.

  $ cd /home/data/svn/crossfire/maps/trunk
  $ ~/svn2cl-0.9/svn2cl.sh --output=ChangeLog.New
  $ diff -u ChangeLog ChangeLog.New >ChangeLog.patch

Verify the ChangeLog.patch file and remove any patch hunks that would remove
information prior to patching up the ChangeLog file for commit.
