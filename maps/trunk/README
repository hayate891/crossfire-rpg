ChangeLog
==============================================================================

The ChangeLog file has been built with svn2cl 0.7 and 0.9 as obtained fromm
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/downloads.html.  Do not use version 0.6
or older as it appears to generate incompatible ChangeLog formats.

These instructions presume an installation of the tarball similar to this.
The actual paths may be different for each developer, but these are used for
sake of example.  There is no requirement to use the example paths.

  $ cd ~
  $ tar -xzf svn2cl-0.9.tar.gz

To update the ChangeLog, a command sequence like this is generally possible
with one caveat.  Do not check in the results without checking the the changes
with svn diff to avoid throwing away someone's comments that are more verbose
than the svn commit comment.

  $ cd /home/data/svn/crossfire/maps/trunk
  $ ~/svn2cl-0.9/svn2cl.sh

The following may be safer, but also may not entirely regenerate missing
entries if manual edits have been made.  Again, never check in updates without
checking differences and merging any manual edits developers may have made.

1) Only generate portion of the ChangeLog since the last svn2cl run.

   Determine the date of the last svn2cl run by looking at the top of the
   ChangeLog.  For this example, presume 2007-12-20 is the last svn2cl
   notation, and that today is 2007-12-30.

   $ cd /home/data/svn/crossfire/maps/trunk
   $ ~/svn2cl-0.9/svn2cl.sh -o ChangeLog.New -r "{2007-12-20}:{2007-12-30}"

   Note that the day of the last svn2cl is used in case new entries were made
   that day following the svn2cl run.

   Place the contents of ChangeLog.New at the top of the ChangeLog file, but
   make sure to delete any redundant entries.  If manual entries have been
   made, merge any additional content with the appropriate svn2cl generated
   entries.

2) Regenerate the entire log, but generate a patch file.

  $ cd /home/data/svn/crossfire/maps/trunk
  $ ~/svn2cl-0.9/svn2cl.sh --output=ChangeLog.New
  $ diff -u ChangeLog ChangeLog.New >ChangeLog.patch

  Verify the ChangeLog.patch file and remove any patch hunks that would remove
  information prior to patching up the ChangeLog file for commit.
