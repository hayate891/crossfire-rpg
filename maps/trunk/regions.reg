msg
Grass, mountains, trees, rivers, and not a soul to be seen for miles around,
the wilderness is not the most civilized of places, and stories
that have reached the towns tell of fearsome creatures and labyrinthine
dungeons far under the surface. Of course, these rumours have never been
verified, though the few who have tried have taken a long time in doing so....

msg
The Imperial Highway was built long ago, so much so that its origins are
now long since passed out of recorded history and into the stuff of legends.
In the years since its construction it has gained the name "The yellow Brick
Road" on account of the distinctive colour of its paving. Whilst in former
times the Imperial highway was safe to all who would pass along it, in
recent times it has started to decay, as the toll of centuries comes to bear
on this once-splendid testament to past powers.

msg
Nestled snugly in a sheltered bay at the west of the Imperial Highway, Scorn
is a safe and welcoming place for those who pass by. Its position on the
Imperial highway allows it to maintain its importance as a stopping off
point between the other major cities along the route and an attractive
location for trade and commerce. This combined with the sheltered harbour and
extensive shipping lines, ensures that Scorn remains a key crossroads
bustling with activity, long after its former military dominance has
diminished.

Outside the gates of the city of scorn, the activity of the town can be heard,
but not seen the cries of the traders, and calls of the sailors belie your
proximity to this bustling town, though to look around you see only the relative
tranquility of quiet farmland and the sense of peace it evokes.

You find yourself gasping in wonder at the extensive caverns underneath the city,
here there remains the ruins of old Scorn. A reminder of the great power the city
once possessed, and a sign of how far it has fallen. As you look around however
you notice that whilst the previous inhabitants of these ruins are no longer
present, some new ones seem to have taken their place, and these denizens don't
appear to be very welcoming.

Straddling the corner of the Imperial highway as it turns North near the
Eastern border of the known world, and surrounded by dangerous territory,
Navar is an unlikely site for one of the world's grandest cities.
Yet there it stands, dominating the skyline for miles around and showing the
same bustling activity expected of any thriving market town.

Stoneville is a small ship port located on the western side of 
Dragon Island. The island primarily serves as a vacation residence 
for wealthy merchants and adventurers.  For those who are not 
quite ready for retirement or seeking fame - guilds and shops keep
those travelers well stocked and tested.  Of course, the islands 
riches also seem to attract those with nefarious purposes who have 
taken hold of the various caves in the nearby mountains.  And in 
some cases, more closer to home then what most inhabitants would like.
