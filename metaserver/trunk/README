If your looking on how to set up and use these scripts, see the INSTALL
file.

This directory contains the code for the metaserver.  Since the metaserver
will almost certainly run on a system different from either the server or
client, it makes sense for it to be its own directory in order to make updates
easy.

The metaserver is a php + mysql set of scripts.  Reasons for using php +
mysql:

1) These are quite common utilities, and many ISPs or other hosting services
will be able to run these (compared to say a standalone perl script)

2) By being run from a web server, this effectively gives us multithreading -
the metaserver update script can now do operations that may take a while (dns
lookups) which can not be done in a single threaded standalone script.

3) mysql takes care of file locking for us (basically don't need it).  It also
lets us do quick searches, dumps, etc, without needing to rely on other
external programs (grep, sort, etc).  While mysql is used in the initial
version, the code is designed to make it easy to support other SQL compatible
databases.

4) I'm quite familiar with php + mysql, so writing and testing it is much
easier with those tools than some other combination.

Brief description of the files:

common.php: some common routines/values common to all the scripts.
meta_client.php: Script that provides the data to the client in easy to
  parse form.
meta_html.php: Script that produces HTML table for viewing in a browser.
meta_update.php: Script that the server uses (via HTTP_POST) to update
  its information.
mysql_db.php: File that provides wrapper functions around the mysql
  calls.
