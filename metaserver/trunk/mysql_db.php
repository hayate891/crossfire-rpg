// The point of this file is to abstract the
// database operations so that instead of the meta_..
// scripts making mysql calls directly, they make
// generic db_.. calls.  In this way, to support
// a different database only requires including a different
// file here, and not rewriting the scripts to use postgres,
// oracle, whatever calls.  Note - the meta_.. scripts
// do presume that some form of SQL backend will be used -
// it would have been possible to move the calls into
// this file here, but that would basically amount to
// each query being its own function here - I'm not
// sure that would be worthwhile.
