These are sounds for Crossfire sound server.

These are original crossfire sounds converted to raw-linear unsigned format.
Also their volume is normalized, for better effects.

To use them, install cfsndserv somewhere in your PATH, compile the client with
-DNEW_SOUND, change the "sounds" file, so it contains proper paths and install
it to your ~/.crossfire.

Greets,

UPDATED NOTES:

1) -DNEW_SOUND is not a valid build option and is no longer needed.

2) See the sounds.dist source file under SVN client/sound-src.  make
   produces sounds from sounds.dist.  If a player wants to change sounds
   played, this sounds file is copied to ~/.crossfire and adjusted to
   associate different sound files with various events.

3) The .raw sound files are installed under the client data directory
   ${prefix}/share/crossfire-client/sounds.
