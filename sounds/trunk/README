These are sounds for Crossfire sound server.
These are original crossfire sounds converted to raw-linear unsigned format.
Also their volume is normalized, for better effects.
To use them - install cfsndserv somhere in your PATH, compile client
with -DNEW_SOUND, change the "sounds" file, so it contains proper paths
and install it to your ~/.crossfire
