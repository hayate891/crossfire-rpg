#
# This is a reasonably heavily modified version of the sounds file from the
# server.
#
# Originally it was felt that full path names were needed, but since this file
# was installed in the user's .crossfire directory, that meant all it would
# take to break sound was to install the sound files somewhere else.  It is
# better to make the sound server use a location determined at build time - in
# addition to allowing use of a user-accessible cache to allow override of the
# default sound set.  Henceforth, paths should NOT be present in this file,
# and, along these same lines, the sound name in column one should not include
# a .extension (like .raw or .ogg).
#
# There are two sections - one for normal sounds, and one for spell sounds.
# They are differentiated by the header 'Standard Sounds:' and 'Spell Sounds:'
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Format of the file:  pathname to sound, default volume (what volume gets
# played if it is centered on the player), symbolic name (not currently used
# for anything, but may be in the future for the server to communicated to the
# client), and sound number..  Symbolic name and sound number may be ommitted.
# If sound number is missing, the sound will be assigned one higher than the
# last sound read in.
#
# the symbolic name can be DEFAULT, in which case all sounds for that section
# which are otherwise not set will be set to that value.  This can be
# especially useful for that magic section, since new spells get added fairly
# often.
#
# The volume of 100 means max volume.  Anything higher may break the sound
# handling.
#
# The server does not currently communicate what sound to play via the sound
# number, so this file is technically obsolete and is likely to discontinued
# once cfsndserv is better equipped to support the sound2 protocol.
#
# If a copy of this file is in ~/.crossfire/, it is loaded from there.
