Changes for Crossfire 0.93.3:

Number of images cleaned up/improved/created by David Sundqvist.

Several new images/archetyps added - new wall types, dedicated altars for
the gods (very nicely looking), and some other changes by David.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.7

Cleaned up the dev directory some - got rid of a bunch of files that have
since been merged.  Also, got rid of things that should no longer be
applicable (via code changes), and stuff in which there was only and archetype
object - there should be enough examples out there on how to create new
archetyps.

Weight for some monsters updated to be in more in line with what should be
expected.

Editable cleaned up for a bunch of objects.

Half orc and halfling player types added.

Some archetyps for throwing added

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.6

Several objects added for Brian Thomas valley quest maps - some disabled
archetypes moved back into palce.

Changes for Crossfire 0.92.5

Many archetypes added for the kunji maps.

Changes for Crossfire 0.91.7

Many new archetypes added by Brian Thomas (thomas@nomad.astro.psu.edu).
These are spread out in many different directories.

Spectres are no longer animated.  In this way, invisibilty on them works
properly.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.5:

Changed editable value in some items so they appear in the proper
place for crossedit.

Moved all files in the 'item' directory into misc.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.4:

Added DarkOrange to xpm.template file.  Before, there were only
two oranges, and the dark orange was closer to a brown.

Cleaned up some of the X Pixmaps.  Eliminated some colors from the
various files that are not in the official xpm.template file.

Merged the soda archetypes in.  Like Chico, they were at least
partially colored as I transfered them.

Tried to clean up the directories some.  All spell effects should
now be in magic, where as items that are related to spells (wands,
books, horns, rods, etc) are in spells.  Either item or misc should
be removed, as the stuff in them seems like it could be placed
in the other directory.

Changes for crossfire 0.90.3:
Merged chico archetypes in their proper location, instead of being
in a separate directly.  Colored them as I went.
