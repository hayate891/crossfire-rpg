Potion directory.

 What with color pixmaps and all, a separate copy of the restore potions
is needed compared to the normal potions.  For bitmaps, this doesn't make
a difference, but the file needs to at least exist (as such, links are used).
But for the actual XPM files, these are colored differently.
