These are the official RedHAte 6.2 crossfire client RPMS.
The crossfire-client rpm is the old old. 

The crossfire-client-gtk is the newer GTK client as is GNOME 
aware and will  install itself under GNOME Foot->Programs->Games, I highly
recommend this client. 

The crossfire-client-sounds is if you want to have sounds 
during game play.
