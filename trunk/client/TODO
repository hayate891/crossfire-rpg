Things to do in no particular order:

gnome client: Make it work.  IT compiles, but there is something in the
  map code (or someplace else) causing stack overflows.  What really needs
  to get done is for it to share much more of the code with the gtk client.

x11: Modify to support variable sized images.  create_status_icons
   needs to be redone to load png files instead of Xpm's (since we
   no longer check for Xpm

Have containers present number of objects/number of different objects in
 name.

Add a damfactor display to the client (this would be weapon speed *
damage of the weapon)
