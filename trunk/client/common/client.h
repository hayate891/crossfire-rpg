 * this makes processing in the gui aspect of the GTK
 * client much easier.  There are also 2 elements -
 * want options, and use_options.  The former is what the
 * player wants to use, the later is what is currently
 * in use.  There are many options that can not be
 * switched between during actual play, but we want to 
 * record what the player has changed them to so that 
 * when we save them out, we save what the player wants,
 * and not what is currently being used.  Note that all the gui
 * interfaces may not use all these values, but making them
 * available here makes it easy for the GUI to present a 
 * nice interface.
 * 0 is intentially skipped so the index into this doesn't
 * get a default if a table has a blank value
