 * represent how many spaces (up and to the left) that image extends
 * into.
 * The tails are values that the client fills in - if we get
 * a big head value, we fill in the tails value so that the display
 * logic can easily redraw one space.  In this case, the size_ values
 * are offsets that point to the head.  In this way, the draw logic
 * can look at the size of the image, look at these values, and
 * know what portion of it to draw.
