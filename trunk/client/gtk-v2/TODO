This file is meant to be a short list of things that need
to be done, in no particular order (thus, unnumbered)

- Make an image for the 'icons' inventory tab (perhaps an eye?)

- add support for SDL client.

- Perhaps add opengl support

- Implement the arrow buttons to scroll map around so that the player does not
have to be in the middle (eg, after you thing you have completed a level, you
should be able to scroll around and look at the fog of war spaces and see if
you've missed anything).

- add a window for metaserver selection - popup window would be nice
because it can then show the full info of the metaserver - right now, for
reasons of compactness, the comment section of the metaserver is stripped off.

- Add a window for configuration selection, as well as key binding/unbinding.

- Perhaps a better splash graphic to show while not connected, since there is
a lot more space that is not being used.

- perhaps tie in some display options with scripting?  Eg, and inventory tab
in which an external script can be used to determine whether to show objects
or not, perhaps same for information messages?

- Fix any of the probably numerous bugs.
