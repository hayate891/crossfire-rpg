#
# This is a reasonably heavily modified version of the sounds file from
# the server.
#
# Since the client has to load the sounds on its own, full path names
# are needed.
#
# There are two sections - one for normal sounds, and one for spell
# sounds.  They are differentiated by the header 'Standard Sounds:' and
# 'Spell Sounds:'
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Format of the file:  pathname to sound, default volume (what volume gets
# played if it is centered on the player), symbolic name (not currently
# used for anything, but may be in the future for the server to communicated
# to the client), and sound number..  Symbolic name and sound number may
# be ommitted.  If sound number is missing, the sound will be assigned one
# higher than the last sound read in.
#
# the symbolic name can be DEFAULT, in which case all sounds for that section
# which are otherwise not set will be set to that value.  This can be
# especially useful for that magic section, since new spells get added
# fairly often.
#
# The volume of 100 means max volume.  Anything higher may break the sound
# handling.
#
# The server currently communicates what sound to play via the sound
# number - you should not change those.  However, you can change most
# of the other sounds without problem.
#
# If a copy of this file is in ~/.crossfire/, it will be loaded
#
