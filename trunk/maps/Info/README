In this directory is utilities, gif images of the maps, and other notes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer guidelines:

Read the mapguide for guidelines on making a good map.

Use the comment field that the maps have - put in who the author is,
what level the map is, and any other special notes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naming Scheme:

Note that these rules are ordered in importance, eg, if a rule conflicts,
the lower number rule takes precedence.

1) If the map is currently off the main world (eg, pupland), it should have
   its own top level ldirectory which all the maps in that area are located.

2) Each city should have it own top level directory (eg, scorn,
   navar_city, santo_dominion).  All buildings in the city and located
   nearby or related to it are in the respectice city directory.

For maps that are placed directly on the world map and are not in the city,
the follow guidelines should be used:

3) If the map is part of a larger quest, a /quest/name_of_quest directory
   should be made, and all the maps for the quest placed in there.  If
   some portions of the quest has maps in cities or other places, a README
   should be included explaining this.  Note in general, having README's
   for all quests explaining the flow probably isn't a bad idea in the
   case someone else needs to work on it.

4) If a map is independent (eg, the map is one you just go there, kill and
   get exp), it should be in the /dungeons directory (Ill named I know).
   If the dungeon is comprised of several map (eg, multilevel dungeon), a
   sub directory should be made to hold all of these maps.

5) Maps should fall into one of the category above - if it does not, and
   you are not sure, send a message to crossfire-devel@lists.real-time.com.
   Maps should not be sorted by author, as this does not make maintaining
   them easy.

Important landmarks

If you are going to use these world maps, you should probably update
the following values in the server include/config.h file:
#define EMERGENCY_MAPPATH "/world/world_105_115"
#define EMERGENCY_X 5
#define EMERGENCY_Y 37


Scorn is located on world maps _104_115 and _105_115.  Some touchup of the
terrain immediately surrounding the city has been touched up some.

Santo Dominion is on maps _102_108

The list of translation values below have been used in the update_maps
script.  The values are recoreded here in that they might be useful for
updating other maps that are contributed later.

The format is:
OLD_MAP_NAME, OLD_MAP_STARTX, OLD_MAP_STARTY, OLD_MAP_ENDX, OLD_MAP_ENDY ->
	NEW_MAP_NAME, NEW_MAP_OFFX, NEW_MAP_OFFY

Translation values used:
/city/city, 10, 0 (100,100) -> /world/world_105_115, -10, 18

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
land.c:
This is the program that generated the new world map.

The file land.c just gets compiled - if your system has a math
library (-lm) you probably need to link that in.

Given the same seed and other parameters, it will generate the same
results if on the same platform.  Eg, two different intel systems running
redhat 7.2 should generate the same results, but a redhat compared to
solaris system, or linux intel vs linux power pc may very well generate
different results.

The generated map was run with the follow parameters on my system:
-x 1500 -y 1500 -s 1007623715 -p 300 -n 170 -w 40000 -l 200000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIF files:

el_map.gif is an elevation map - it is color coded based on elevations.

terrain_map.gif is color coded based on the type of terrain - I tried to match
the coloration on what the image looks like in the png set.

ann_map.gif is a annotated version of the map, showing the roads and
locations of the main cities.

Completed maps:

city (now scorn) - moved
santo_dominion: moved

individual linked maps:
eeur/hut.1, hut.2 (in santo_dominion)
espen/palace, espen1, espen2 (in santo_dominion)
