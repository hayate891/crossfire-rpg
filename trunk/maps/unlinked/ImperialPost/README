Mail and Messageboard Python scripts for Crossfire
Joris Bontje <jbontje@suespammers.org>

This collection offers scripts and a map that allow you
to send mail to your fellow players and place public
messageboards in the game. Additionally you can request
information about the last visit of a player to a NPC
and use her as a bank.

Requirements:
- Crossfire (1.1 or higher)
- Python (2.0 or higher)
- Python Crossfire plugin (latest)

Installation:
Place the content of python/ in (for example)
/path/to/share/crossfire/maps/python/ and the content of
local/ (with subdirectory ImperialPost) in
/path/to/share/crossfire/maps/local/ImperialPost/

Modify all .py files and change the patchs according to
your installation, don't forget to point to the correct
'var' directory so that the database files can be stored.

The main map for this is 'local/ImperialPost/IPO', link to
it in Scorn.

It is possible to place multiple messageboards in your
game, copy the example on from local/ImperialPost/IPO and
change 'event_say_options GENERALBOARD' and give it an
unique name.
