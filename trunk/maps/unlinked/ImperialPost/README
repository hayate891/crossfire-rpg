Mail and Messageboard Python scripts for Crossfire
Joris Bontje <jbontje@suespammers.org>

Updated Feb 2002 by Todd Mitchell

This collection offers scripts and a map that allow you
to send mail to your fellow players and place public
messageboards in the game. Additionally you can request
information about the last visit of a player to a NPC
and use her as a bank. (note the bank script has been moved to bankteller.py)

Requirements:
- Crossfire (1.4x or higher(version must have system path functions in Python Plugin))
- Python (2.0 or higher)
- Python Crossfire plugin (latest)

Installation:
Should work by default if python plugin is running

The main map for this is '../ImperialPost/IPO', link to
it in Scorn.

It is possible to place multiple messageboards in your
game, copy the example in the map from /ImperialPost/IPO and
change 'event_say_options GENERALBOARD' and give it an
unique name.
